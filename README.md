# web-scraping-basics
The internet is a host for the largest source of information on earth. <br>
Web scraping is basically extracting raw data from a website. The data gotten could be used for several purposes, and a few of them include sentiment analysis, social media trends analysis, surveys, email address extraction (for email marketing), etc. <br>
Python🐍 is a great web scraper, as it is easy to use, has an easy-to-understand syntax and saves time. Popular python libraries for web scraping include BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium and lxml. <br>
